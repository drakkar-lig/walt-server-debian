# walt normally requires 2 interfaces:
# * an interface for internet connection
# * an interface for connecting walt experimentation network

# If the host has two physical interfaces, the configuration
# can be obvious.
# If it has only one interface, one can configure VLANs
# in file /etc/walt/server.conf in order to use this
# single interface for both networks.

# Here, since this initial setup might be used for quick
# demo purposes, we just require the host to have one
# interface with internet connection (this is eth0).
# In this initial configuration, the walt network (walt-net
# virtual bridge) is virtual-only (parameter 'raw-device' is
# set to 'null' in /etc/walt/server.conf).

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
